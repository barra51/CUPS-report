# CUPS-report

Script to get a better understanding when troubleshooting CUPS jobs.

# What data is processed by this script?

This script takes information from **lpq** and **lpstat**. Since the information is processed in a very similar style, we can mix them with no issues ;)

Feel free to use in production environments. **This script does not modify or process any file.** Only takes the output from lpq and lpstat and shows you in a nice view.
